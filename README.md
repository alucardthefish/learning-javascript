# JavaScript Crash Learning

Learning from Traversy JS Crash Course on YouTube

## Notes from learning process

* Scripts must be at the end of body

### Variables

* `var` has a global scope
* `let` and `const` have a block level scope
* When do we use `let` or `const`? - Always use `const` unless you know you're going to reasign the value
